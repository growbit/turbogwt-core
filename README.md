Turbo GWT (*TurboG*) Core
==

**Turbo GWT** is a suite of micro-frameworks, inspired by famous Javascript MVVM frameworks like Knockout.js and Angular.js, intended to speed up development of GWT applications grounded on the MVP pattern.

**Turbo GWT Core** contains JavaScriptObject extensions intended to improve performance of any GWT application. These classes are reused along other TurboG modules too.
